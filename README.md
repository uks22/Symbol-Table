Symbol table : It is a table used by compiler to keep track of details related to variables in each block defined. It also keep track of scope of variables.
I have implemented symbol table using linked list of Hashtables(to store name and values of varaibles defined). Here Linked list is used as stack.
Hastable is implemented using closed addressing technique known as Bucketing/Chaining method.
